    // Question 2
    // a. using a java method (function) write a program to compute the simple interest using the formula
    //    Simple Interest = P * T * R {divided by} 100
    // b. How will you explain the following term to a novice as they relate to java programming?
    //    i. Method  ii. Class  iii. Operator Overloading  iv. abstraction  v. primitive types

    // Answer

    // 2a
    static void calculateSimpleInterest(double p, double t, double r) {
        double top = p * t * r;                // top = p * t * r
        double result = top / 100;             // result = p * t * r / 100

        System.out.println("SOLUTION");
        System.out.println("Simple Interest = " + result + " Naira");    // print out: Simple interest = result Naira
    }

    public static void main(String [] args){
        calculateSimpleInterest(1000, 60, 5);                   // call method
    }

    // 2b
    // Method: this is a function that does something. e.g a human being can walk, can talk, can eat, can sleep, can sing.
    //         These are methods(or functions) a human being can do.
    // Class:  this is the blueprint for creating an object e.g a human being can be a class, while an object of the human being class(blueprint)
    //         can be Mr. Yusuf, Mr. Aremu, Mr. Emmanuel Azuaba
    // Operator Overloading: this means an operator(e.g + - / *) can be used on different data types to get different results
    //                       e.g x = 5 + 5        // x = 10
    //                       e.g y = "a" + "b"    // y = ab
    // Abstraction:          this basically means "hiding data" and only showing data that is relevant to the user
    // Primitive DataTypes:  this is a data type that is built into the programming language and can be used to get all other data types
