    // Question 1
    // a. The saying "write once and run anywhere" describe what java as a language is. As a java programmer, list and explain five features that
    //    support the assertion in bold.
    // b. Write a java method to compute the quadratic equation using the formula

    // Answer
    // 1a.
    // What java is?
    // Java is a high-level, easy to write, class-based, object-oriented programming language/
    // List and explain Five features?
    // - Inheritance:  Java allows for classes to be inherited by other classes. Basically allowing the class that inherits to be a subclass (child class)
    //                 to the class it inherits from (parent class). The child class is able to inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class
    // - Polymorphism: First off polymorphism means "many forms". And this occurs when we have classes that are related together through inheritance, or
    //                 when we create different objects of a class, all behaving in many forms.
    //                 use: makes the code re-usable
    // - Abstraction:  First off abstraction is basically "hiding". Java allows us to abstract data (which means hide data) from user and only showing essential
    //                 data to the user
    //                 use: reduces complexity and increases efficiency
    // - Encapsulation: First off encapsulation means "hiding sensitive data". Java allows for data to be encapsulated(hidden) and un accessible outside the
    //                  class the data is declared there for making our programs secure
    //                  use: improves the security when writing programs
    // - Easy to learn and write: Java is easy to learn. Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than
    //                            other programming languages
