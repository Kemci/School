VARIABLE
Is a memory location that holds different data types such as float, string etc.

METHOD 
Is a block of code that performs one function/action within a class. Actions performed on methods are created and call

ACCESS MODIFIERS
Access modifiers are keywords used to specify the accessibility of a class (or type) and its members.
- Public (access at any point of the code)
- Protected
- default 
- Private (access only within a class)

Access-modifier > return-type > name-of-method (argument){code}
Eg.
 Public float calculatePotentialEnergy (float m, float g, float h) {} 


NON-ACCESS MODIFIERS
1. Final - attributes and methods cannot be overridden/modified
2. Static - attributes and methods belong to class rather than object


CAMELCASE
Methods, Objects and Variables - Start with small letters then other words start with a capital letter eg. princeKwemziAondover 
Class - all words start with a capital letter 



CLASS
Class is a blueprint or template that models an object

Features of class
Attributes, state, fields (Variable) eg. Type of drink, price etc.
Behaviour (methods) eg. addMoreDrinks, removeDrinks etc.

Types of Classes
Nested Classes (a class inside another class)
Anonymous classes (nameless class)

CONSTRUCTOR
A method with the same name as a class

CREATING A CLASS
ClassName ObjectName = new Constructor () e.g
Main drinks = new Main ();  


ABSTRACTION
Is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.


ENCAPSULATION: 
To make sure that sensitive data are hidden from the user

Public class person {
   Private String name;
   Public String getName(){
   return name;
   }
  Public String getName (String newName) {
       this.name = newName;
    }
}

INHERITANCE 
is a subclass that inherit all the attributes and method of a superclass.

POLYMORPHISM: 
is a concept by which the can perform a single action in many ways. 






FOR LOOP
For > start-position; end-position; increment(i++)/decrement(I—){}
For (int I=10; I<= 100; I++){}



ERROR
Errors are problems within your program that occur at compiling time.

Types of Errors
MemoryException
ArrayOutOfBounds

DATA PARSING: converting one data type to another.

INTERFACE
An interface is an abstract type that defines a class.


SOLID PRINCIPLES
S- Single Responsibility Principle (every java class should perform a single functionality)
O- Open-Closed Principle ( A class should be open to extensions but closed to multifunction)
L- Leskov Subtraction Principle (derived (child) class should be substitutable for a parent class)
I- Interface Segregation Principle (clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t have)
D- Dependency Inversion Principle (a class should not depend on the concrete implementation of another class but instead its abstraction)

ERROR VS EXCEPTION

note: Java cannot inherit more than one class

FUNCTION OVERRIDING
Function overriding is a feature that allows us to have the same function in the child class which is already present in the parent class.  THE CHILD CLASS OVERRIDES THE SUPERCLASS

FUNCTION OVERLOADING
Function overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters. SAME PARAMETER DIFFERENT RETURN TYPE

import java.util.*;  
public class Swap_With {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
       int x, y, t;
       Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);  
       System.out.println("Enter the value of X and Y");  
       x = sc.nextInt();  
       y = sc.nextInt();  
       System.out.println("Before Swap: "+x +"  "+ y);  
       
       t = x;  
       x = y;  
       y = t;  
       System.out.println("After Swap: "+x +"   " + y);  
       System.out.println( );  
    }    
}


SWING 
swing is a part of java foundation classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications

Unlike Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT) -Java swing provides platform-independent and lightweight component
